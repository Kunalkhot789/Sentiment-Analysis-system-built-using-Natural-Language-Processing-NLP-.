# Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project implements a sentiment analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The goal of the project is to analyze unstructured textual data and extract meaningful insights by understanding the emotional tone of user input.

The system accepts text input from the user, processes it using basic NLP techniques, calculates a sentiment polarity score, and classifies the sentiment accordingly. This project demonstrates fundamental NLP concepts and their practical application using Python.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to automate the process of understanding user opinions expressed in text. It aims to transform raw textual data into structured sentiment information that can be used for analysis and decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Textual data such as customer reviews, feedback, and comments is unstructured and difficult to analyze manually. This project addresses the challenge by applying NLP-based sentiment analysis to automatically determine whether the sentiment expressed in a given text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Methodology
The project follows a simple and structured approach:
- Accept text input from the user
- Perform basic text preprocessing
- Analyze sentiment polarity using NLP techniques
- Classify sentiment based on polarity score
- Display the sentiment result along with the polarity value

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TextBlob (or equivalent NLP library)
- Jupyter Notebook
